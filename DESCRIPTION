Description: Compute correlation and other association matrices from
    small to very large datasets with simple, cor()-like functions and sensible
    defaults. Includes options for shrinkage and robustness to improve results
    in noisy or high-dimensional settings (p >= n), plus convenient print/plot
    methods for inspection. Implemented with optimised C++ backends using
    BLAS/OpenMP and memory-aware symmetric updates. Works with base matrices
    and data frames, returning standard R objects via a consistent S3 interface.
    Useful across genomics, agriculture, and machine-learning workflows.
