Description: Provides fast and extensible computation of correlation matrices
    using optimized C++ routines. Supports both rank-based and parametric
    methods, including efficient implementations of Kendall's tau (tau-a and
    tau-b), with extensibility for Spearman, Pearson, and other correlation
    metrics. Designed for high-performance statistical computing in
    applications such as genomics, finance, and machine learning, especially
    in high-dimensional settings.
